# Digital Image Encryption Using Lorenz Equation and Chaotic Systems

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative image encryption technique using the Lorenz equation and chaotic systems. This method provides a robust solution for encrypting digital images, ensuring their security and integrity.

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of chaotic systems, specifically the Lorenz equation, in the field of image encryption. By leveraging the unpredictability of chaos theory, we have developed a method that enhances the security of digital images against unauthorized access.

### Concepts Used
- **Lorenz Equations**: A set of three ordinary differential equations used to model chaotic systems.
- **RK Method (Runge Kutta Methods)**: Numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations, critical in our encryption algorithm.

## Dependencies Required
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

## Running the Code
- Run the `ImageEncryption.py` file.
- To change the image that is being encrypted, modify the path of the image mentioned in line number 56 of the code.
- This process will generate the actual image that is being used.
- The encrypted image will be displayed.
- The decrypted image using the actual key will be shown.
- The decrypted image using an improper key will also be displayed for comparison.

## Implementation
The codebase includes algorithms for encrypting and decrypting images using the Lorenz system's chaotic behavior. The methodology involves applying the RK-4 (Runge Kutta) method to generate encryption keys and performing XOR operations for the encryption process.

### Key Features
- Ability to secure digital images using a robust encryption algorithm.
- Utilization of Lorenz equations and chaotic systems for generating unpredictable encryption keys.
- Implementation of the RK-4 method for precise calculations in the encryption process.

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the code to encrypt and decrypt images. Include examples and screenshots if available.

## Future Enhancements
- Development of a Python-based GUI for easier interaction with the encryption tool.
- Extension of the algorithm to support other image formats and text encryption.
- Exploration of other numerical methods to further enhance encryption efficiency.
